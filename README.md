# Python: Codecademy Project 2
My second portfolio project from the Data Science Foundations Skill Path on Codecademy Pro, investigating whether there is a strong correlation between the economic output of a country and the life expectancy of its citizens.

This project uses data visualisation and a variety of different plots (bar charts, violin plots, swarm plots, line charts, scatter plots) to answer the following questions:
- What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
- What is the distribution of that life expectancy?
- Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
- Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
- Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
